Actual starting point before the delay:
    - First block with transactions. call it :  start

Starting Point of the actual test run (2min Delay):
    - block with a timeStamp that is closest to the 120 mark
        from start.timeStamp. call it : testStartBlock

All the calculations below are based on blocks after the starting block 
of the test-run after delay has been located

Average Block size:  sum(each block_size)/total_blocks

blockTime(n) = timeStamp(n) - timeStamp(n-1)
Average Block Time:  sum(block_time for each block)/total_blocks

IntervalStart = testStartBlock.timeStamp
IntervalEnd   = lastBlock.timeStamp

txSent = tps * (IntervalEnd - IntervalStart)
totalTransactions = total trasnactions in all the block starting from testStartBlock
txSuccessRate = (totalTrasnactions/txSent)


txThroughPut = totalTransactionsInBlock/blockTimeOfBlock
avgTxThroughPut = sum(txThroughPut for each block)/total_blocks 

cpuAvg = sum(cpuUsage at each timestamp after delay)/total_dataPoints
ramAvg = sum(ramUsage at each timestamp after delay)/total_dataPoints
